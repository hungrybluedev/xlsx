# xlsx

## Description

A package in pure V for reading and writing (soon) Excel files in the XLSX format.

## Roadmap

- [x] Read XLSX files.
- [ ] Write XLSX files.

## Installation

```bash
v install https://github.com/hungrybluedev/xlsx
```

## Usage

### Reading XLSX files

Take the `data.xlsx` file from the `examples/01_marksheet` directory for this example.

```v
import xlsx

fn main() {
	workbook := xlsx.Document.from_file('path/to/data.xlsx')!
	println('[info] Successfully loaded workbook with ${workbook.sheets.len} worksheets.')

	println('\nAvailable sheets:')
	// sheets are stored as a map, so we can iterate over the keys.
	for index, key in workbook.sheets.keys() {
		println('${index + 1}: "${key}"')
	}

	// Excel uses 1-based indexing for sheets.
	sheet1 := workbook.sheets[1]

	// Note that the Cell struct is able to the CellType.
	// So we can have an idea of what to expect before getting all
	// the data as a dataset with just string data.
	dataset := sheet1.get_all_data()!

	count := dataset.row_count()

	println('\n[info] Sheet 1 has ${count} rows.')

	headers := dataset.raw_data[0]

	println('\nThe headers are:')
	for index, header in headers {
		println('${index + 1}. ${header}')
	}

	println('\nThe student names are:')

	for index in 1 .. count {
		row := dataset.raw_data[index]
		// All data is stored as strings, so we need to convert it to the appropriate type.
		roll := row[0].int()
		name := row[1] + ' ' + row[2]
		println('${roll:02d}. ${name}')
	}
}

```

Remember to replace `'path/to/data.xlsx'` with the actual path to the file.

After you are done, run the program:

```bash
v run marksheet.v
```

You should see the following output:

```plaintext
[info] Successfully loaded workbook with 1 worksheets.

Available sheets:
1: "1"

[info] Sheet 1 has 11 rows.

The headers are:
1. Roll Number
2. First Name
3. Last Name
4. Physics
5. Chemistry
6. Biology
7. Mathematics
8. Total
9. Percentage

The student names are:
01. Priya Patel
02. Kwame Nkosi
03. Mei Chen
04. Aisha Adekunle
05. Javed Khan
06. Mei-Ling Wong
07. Oluwafemi Adeyemi
08. Yuki Takahashi
09. Rashid Al-Mansoori
10. Sanya Verma
```

Try running the example on other XLSX files to see how it works. Modify the example to suit your needs.

### Writing XLSX files

_Coming soon!_

## Get Involved

- It is a good idea to have examples files ready for testing. Ideally, the test files should be as small as possible.
- If it is a feature request, please provide a detailed description of the feature and how it should work.

### On GitHub

1. Create issues for bugs you find or features you want to see.
2. Fork the repository and create pull requests for contributions.

### On Discord

1. Join the V Discord server: https://discord.gg/vlang
2. Write in the `#xlsx` channel about your ideas and what you want to do.
